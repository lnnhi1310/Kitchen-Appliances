        <p>Today, TASHA reaches millions of hearts and homes all over the world, but every success story has to start somewhere. Did you know that TASHA once was as a tiny business 
         selling through a mail-order catalog? And that the TASHA headquarters for design are still located there? Here’s our story.</p>

        <h2>Our roots</h2>
        <p>Group 1 founded TASHA in 2022 at the age of 17, selling household goods like pan, spoon and storage box. Ho Chi Minh city, the landscape where Group 1 grew up,
          was stony and rugged. Back then, many of the inhabitants had to get by with small means, making as much as possible with next to nothing. Because of this, Ho CHi Minh city
          are said to be thrifty and innovative, with a “no-nonsense” approach to everyday problem solving. This heritage is one explanation to the TASHA way of doing things and to our success.</p>

          <h2>Our first kitchen showroom</h2>
          <p>The prices in the first TASHA catalog were so low that people were initially skeptical about the quality of the products, so Group 1 decided to convert an old workshop in 
            Ho Chi Minh city into a showroom where people could look at and try products before ordering.</p>

        <h2>We love challenges!</h2>
        <p>Throughout our history, our best ideas have come from our biggest challenges, and we believe this is what makes us different. Today, TASHA is one of the most 
          well-known kitchen home store brands in the world and, if we include the many thousands employed by our suppliers, around one million people is working with us to 
          make our vision to create a better everyday life for the many people become reality. And this is just the beginning. Like Ingvar Kamprad used to say, “Most things 
          still remain to be done. A glorious future!”</p>
