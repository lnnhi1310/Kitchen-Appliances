        <h3>Shipping method</h3>
        <p>Shipping methods are the rates and services that customers can choose from at checkout. They’re often based on the carriers you work with, 
          and determine what shoppers pay for shipping and how quickly they’ll receive their purchase. Here are a few ways you can charge for shipping:<br>
          <li>A variable amount based on weight, location, and delivery speed</li>
          <li>A flat rate, such as $5.00, no matter what items are ordered</li>
          <li>Free shipping</li></p> 
        <p>Shipping products successfully is one of the most important parts of the customer experience. Shoppers expect to pay as little as possible for shipping,
           receive their order quickly, and find all their products in perfect condition. While there are a lot of moving pieces, shipping doesn’t have to be complicated.
           Let’s take a step back and define some common shipping terms: carriers, methods, and fulfillment solutions.</p>
        <p>You might want to have different shipping speeds, like standard, expedited, or overnight. Or you might offer free shipping for orders over 
          $35.00. It all depends on your shipping strategy.</p>
        <p>If you decide to charge a variable amount for shipping, the best way to get accurate rates is to connect your store to your carrier using an extension. 
          The extension will automatically calculate shipping charges in real time, based on weight, box size, destination, and other factors so that customers never 
          overpay and you’re never stuck with higher costs than anticipated.</p>
        <p>Shipping labels tell your carrier where the package is supposed to go, when it’s supposed to arrive, and how much you paid to get it there. While you can get
           shipping labels from your carrier’s location, like the post office, it’s often easier to print them from your place of business. </p>
